MUSIC requires GSL libraries to be installed
https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
as well as MPI (e.g. MPICH or OpenMPI) and a C++ compiler.  
It only runs properly on POSIX operating systems 
(tested on LINUX and Mac OS X).

You can compile MUSIC by typing "make", which will 
create an executable called "mpihydro".

An input file is required that contains the line "EndOfData", 
preceded by a list of parameter names and values, one per line,
with parameter names and values separated by a space or tab.
If omitted, each parameter will be assigned a default value.  
The list of possible parameters and default values, along
with a brief description, can be found by reading the function 
"ReadInData2" in main.cpp.
A simple example is included in file "input_sample", which runs
a quick hydro event on a coarse grid, and can be used to verify 
that the code compiles and runs without errors.

MUSIC can be invoked by MPI.  For example, to run on two processors 
and use the sample input file, type:
mpiexec -n 2 ./mpihydro input_sample
